# Juni's School Projects

An archive of my school projects for taking Video Game Design at my high school in the 2022-2023 school year.

## Projects
The first few are game recreations that were assigned to us. I mean, it's honestly a good way to learn.

The column on the left with the slightly-boring names are links to each of the games' release pages.\
The column on the right with the funny names are direct download links to each of the games' source codes.

That't about it. More information about each game can be found in their respective release notes.\
Also, ignore the soruce code thats found under each of the releases. This just contains all the source code for every game. So if you want the source of just one game, just download one of the folders in the main branch.
